GENERAL QUESTIONS

What does SQL stand for? - SQL stands for Structured Query Language.
Name two Python Modules that work with SQL. - For example, sqlite3 and psycopg2.

SQL TABLES
Which two methods do you know to create tables in SQL? Give an example command for each of them.

Method 1:

CREATE TABLE account (
     user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	username VARCHAR (50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
	password VARCHAR (50) NOT NULL,
	email VARCHAR (250) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
	create_on TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
	last_login TIMESTAMP);

(comment: SERIAL datatype is used by PostgreSQL for a PRIMARY KEY)

Method 2:

CREATE TABLE new_account AS
SELECT username, created_on
FROM account
WHERE user_id > 3;


How can you enter data into a table in SQL?

INSERT INTO account (user_id, username, password, email, create_on)
VALUES (1, 'Maria', 'password', 'maria_2@mail.com', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP );

How can you change data in your table?

UPDATE account
SET email= 'maria_2@hotmail.com'
WHERE user_id = 1;

Name and describe 4 constraints you can add to columns in SQL.
1. PRIMARY KEY – this constraint is the combination of NOT NULL and UNIQUE constraints. It uniquely identifies each record in a table.
2. NOT NULL – the value of the column cannot be NULL .
3. CHECK – enables to check a condition when one inserts or updates data.
4. DEFAULT - used to set a default value for a column.

Give an example for all of them.

CREATE TABLE employees (
emp_id SERIAL PRIMART KEY,
first_name VARCHAR (50) NOT NULL,
last_name VARCHAR (50) NOT NULL,
birthdate date check (birthdate > '1900-01-01'),
hire_date date check (hire_date > birthdate),
salary integer check (salary > 0),
city VARCHAR (50) DEFAULT 'Berlin');

SELECTIONS
How can you select all entries in a table in SQL?
SELECT * FROM account;

What are the meanings of NOT NULL, ORDER BY and WHERE in SQL?
NOT NULL - used with IS to filter records without values.
ORDER BY - allows a suer to sort the rows returned from the SELECT statement in ascending or descending order based on criteria specified by different criteria.
WHERE - allows a user to add conditions so that to filter the rows returned from the SELECT statement.

Give an example for all three of them.

(NOT NULL)
SELECT last_login
FROM account
WHERE last_login IS NOT NULL;

(ORDER BY)
SELECT customer_id, first_name, last_name, address_id FROM customer
WHERE first_name LIKE 'E%' AND address_id < 500
ORDER BY customer_id DESC
LIMIT 1;

(WHERE)
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM customer
WHERE first_name LIKE 'J%';
